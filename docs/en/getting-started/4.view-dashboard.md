# Step 4 - View dashboard
After your application sends data (or the sample data are sent) to the pipeline, you can view the out-of-the-box dashboards that the solution created in QuickSight.

## Steps

1. Log into **Clickstream Analytics on AWS Console**.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Projects**, then select the project (`quickstart`) you just created in previous steps, click its title, and it will bring you to the project page.
2. On the project detail page, click `pipeline ID` or **View Details** button, and it will bring you to the pipeline detail page.
3. In the pipeline details page, select the **Reporting** tab, and you will see the link to the dashboards created for your app.
4. Click the dashboard link with the name of your app, and it will bring you to the QuickSight dashboard. You should see a dashboard similar to below in your QuickSight Account.
